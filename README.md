The repository has 8 different R codes.

1. `01_HOI_dynamics_code.R` main source code for Lotka-Volterra HOI and pairwise dynamics.

2. `02_Negative_3wayHOI.R` and '03_Positive_3wayHOI.R` are codes that calculate the invasion growth rates in pairwise competition and in presence of HOI and reproduces *figure 1* and *figure 2*.

3. `04_Weyls_negativeHOI.R` and `05_Weyls_positiveHOI.R` are codes that look at the example cases discussed in the methods that either satisfy Weyl's inequality or it does not. 

4. `06_HOI_parameterspace_sims.R` is the code that looks at mutlispecies coexistence across a range of HOI values that either satifies Weyls inequality or does not. Produces *figure 5* and *figureS15-16*

5. Rest of the codes `07_Negative_4wayHOI.R` and `08_Positive_4wayHOI.R` are for four-way HOIs that compares the invasion growth rate of pairwise interaction to invasion growth rates with four-way HOIs.
